A 33-year-old woman is dead and nine others are injured “as a result of a large crowd pushing” during  a concert Sunday night in Rochester, New York, police said. Police initially responded to a report of shots fired inside the Main Street Armory event venue during a concert around 11:05 p.m. Officers found several people injured inside but saw no evidence of a shooting, Rochester police said. “Upon further investigation … none of the injuries sustained to any of the victims were consistent with a person being shot,” Rochester police Lt. Nicholas Adams said. “The injuries appear to be as a result of a large crowd pushing towards the exits following accounts of individuals hearing what they believed to be gunshots.” The tragedy follows a series of deadly crowd surges at entertainment events. In 2021, eight people died at the Astroworld music festival in Houston. Last fall, 158 people were killed in a crush of people during Halloween festivities in a nightlife district of Seoul, South Korea. Authorities in Rochester have not publicly identified the woman who died. Two of the nine people hurt were in “critical, life-threatening condition,” police said. The other seven people had non-life-threatening injuries. It’s “too early to say what precipitated the event,” Rochester Mayor Malik Evans said Monday. “You do not expect to be trampled,” at a concert, the mayor said, saying the tragedy “breaks my heart” and is “totally unacceptable.” Police are interviewing concertgoers and security agents, Rochester Police Chief David Smith said. Investigators are also working with fire marshals to help determine the number of concertgoers in relation to the venue’s capacity. The investigation is in its early stages, and police are asking anyone with video of what happened to come forward, Smith said. Rapper GloRilla, who was performing at the venue Sunday night, offered prayers to those affected. “I’m just now hearing about what happened … praying everybody is ok,” she tweeted.
