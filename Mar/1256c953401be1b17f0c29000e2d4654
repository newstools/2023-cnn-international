The 95th Academy Awards are just about a week away, which means there’s still time to watch some of the nominated films and performances. Many of the movies on the Oscars ballot are now available on streaming services. The multiverse-hopping opus “Everything Everywhere All at Once” – leading the pack with 11 nominations – can be viewed on Showtime Anytime. Netflix is the place to watch “All Quiet on the Western Front,” with nine nominations to its name, while HBO Max offers viewers “The Banshees of Inisherin” – also with nine nods – as well as “Elvis,” just behind those with eight. (CNN and HBO Max are both part of the same parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery.) If Oscar-nominated blockbusters are more your speed, Disney+ has you covered with “Avatar: The Way of the Water,” up for best picture among other categories, and “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” starring record-setting Oscar nominee Angela Bassett.
