Nominations for the 2023 British Academy Film Awards, or BAFTA Awards, have been announced. There were a few surprises among the 24 categories, including a strong showing for “All Quiet on the Western Front,” leading with 14 nominations. Edward Berger’s adaptation is the first time Erich Maria Remarque’s First World War novel has been made into a German-language film. Released by Netflix last fall with little fanfare, it has nevertheless gained significant momentum as awards season ramps up. “The Banshees of Inisherin” follows “All Quiet” with ten nominations, including acting nods for lead Colin Farrell and supporting actors Kerry Condon, Brendan Gleeson and Barry Keoghan. With the same tally is “Everything Everywhere All At Once,” the indie hit that became distributor A24’s first film to cross the $100 million mark at the box office. The awards ceremony, which highlights some of the best British and international  contributions in film of the year, will take place on February 19 at 7p.m. GMT, with actor Richard E. Grant on hosting duties at London’s Royal Festival Hall. Here’s the nominations in full.
