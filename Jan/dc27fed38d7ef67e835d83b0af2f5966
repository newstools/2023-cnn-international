Priscilla Presley is challenging the validity of her late daughter Lisa Marie Presley’s will. In a court filing obtained by CNN, attorneys for Priscilla Presley filed a petition disputing a 2016 amendment to her daughter’s will. The petition states that Lisa Marie Presley removed her mother and her former business manager, Barry Siegel, as co-trustees and replaced them with her children Riley and Benjamin Keough. Benjamin Keough later died in 2020. The petition alleges that, among other issues surrounding the amendment, Priscilla Presley did not receive the amendment while her daughter was alive as required by her Trust and that the document misspells Priscilla’s name. The petition also alleges the amendment was not witnessed or notarized and questions the authenticity Lisa Marie’s signature. “[The signature] appears inconsistent with [Lisa Marie Presley’s] usual and customary signature,” the documents state. CNN has contacted representatives for Priscilla Presley and Lisa Marie Presley’s estate for comment. The petition comes just days after Elvis Presley’s only child was laid to rest at his former residence, Graceland. Lisa Marie Presley died on Jan. 12 after being hospitalized following an apparent cardiac arrest at her Los Angeles home. She was 54. Her cause of death is pending further investigation by the Los Angeles County Coroner.
