A worker who died in an accident at the Montgomery Regional Airport Saturday “was ingested into the engine” of an aircraft, according to a statement from the National Transportation Safety Board. The aircraft, an Embraer 170 operated by regional carrier Envoy Air, “parked at the gate with the parking brake set when a ground support personnel was ingested,” said the agency. “We are saddened to hear about the tragic loss of a team member of the AA/Piedmont Airlines,” said Wade A. Davis, the airport’s executive director, on Saturday. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the family during this difficult time.” American Airlines said in a statement Saturday it was “devastated by the accident involving a team member,” adding, “Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and our local team members. We are focused on ensuring that all involved have the support they need during this difficult time.” The victim has not been named. The Federal Aviation Administration and the transportation safety agency continue to investigate the fatal incident. A preliminary report is expected from the transportation safety agency in two to three weeks, it said. CNN’s Andy Rose and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.
