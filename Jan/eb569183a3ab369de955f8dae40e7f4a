Professional wrestler Jay Briscoe has died at age 38. The US wrestling world is in shock following the announcement of the death of the Ring of Honor (ROH) star, whose real name was Jamin Pugh. Tony Khan, CEO of All Elite Wrestling and owner of ROH, announced the news on Twitter. He wrote: “Sadly, Jamin Pugh has passed away. Known to fans as Jay Briscoe, he was a star in ROH for over 20 years, from the first show until today. “Jay and his brother Mark dominated ROH, reigning as champions to this day. “We’ll do whatever we can to support his family. “Rest In Peace Jamin.” A statement on ROH’s website said: “It is with a heavy heart that we mourn the tragic passing of Jamin Pugh, known to wrestling fans around the world as Jay Briscoe. Our thoughts are with his family, his friends, and his fans.” Numerous wrestling sites have reported that Pugh died in a car accident in Laurel, Delaware on Tuesday.
