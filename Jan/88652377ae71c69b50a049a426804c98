The strange and sentimental film “Everything Everywhere All at Once” led among the films nominated for the 95th Academy Awards on Tuesday, scoring 11 nominations. “All Quiet on the Western Front” and “The Banshees of Inisherin” followed with nine nominations each. Blockbusters “Top Gun: Maverick” and “Avatar: The Way of Water” each landed nominations for best film, and there is plenty of star power among the nominees. Both Rihanna and Lady Gaga were nominated in the original song category (for tunes from “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” and “Top Gun: Maverick,” respectively), as veterans in the industry were recognized as well. Those actors include Angela Bassett, who was nominated in the best supporting actress category for her role in “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever;” Jamie Lee Curtis in the same category for “Everything Everywhere All at Once;” Judd Hirsch in “The Fabelmans,” nominated for best supporting actor; Colin Farrell in “The Banshees of Inisherin,” and Brendan Fraser in “The Whale,” nominated for best actor; and in the best actress category Cate Blanchett for “Tár,” Michelle Williams in “The Fabelmans” and Michelle Yeoh in “Everything Everywhere All at Once.” Allison Williams, who most recently starred in the horror hit “M3GAN,” and Riz Ahmed, who received an Oscar las year for his role in the short film “The Long Goodbye,” announced the nominations.
