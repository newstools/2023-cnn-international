It was a starry night in Los Angeles in spite of repeated spates of rain on Sunday, as awards season continued with the 2023 Critics Choice Awards. The event, hosted by Chelsea Handler, saw celebrities come out in droves even though some – like Colin Farrell and Jamie Lee Curtis – had to stay home after catching Covid-19. Michelle Pfeiffer took the stage to honor Jeff Bridges with the Lifetime Achievement Award, and Kate Hudson presented the SeeHer Award to Janelle Monáe. “Everything Everywhere All at Once” took home the top film award, while “Abbott Elementary” and “Better Call Saul” clinched best comedy and drama television series, respectively.
