Ten children were killed and seven were injured when a boat capsized on a lake in northern Pakistan Sunday, police said. The boat was carrying 25 to 30 students when it capsized on the Tanda Dam Kohat, a lake in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Rescue operations continue, police said. Despite mass drownings occurring frequently in the country, due to overloaded, worn-out vessels overturning in its waters, many people in Pakistan cannot swim. Women are particularly vulnerable in these situations since they typically wear full-coverage clothing, which weighs them down in the water, and a conservative culture discourages them from learning to swim. The tragedy happened on the same day a bus crash in southern Pakistan killed 39 people.
