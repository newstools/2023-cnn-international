British airline Flybe has “ceased trading” and canceled all scheduled flights, the company and the British Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said on Saturday. “Flybe, which operated scheduled services from Belfast City, Birmingham and Heathrow to airports across the United Kingdom and to Amsterdam and Geneva, has ceased trading,” the CAA wrote in a statement. “We urge passengers planning to fly with this airline not to go to the airport as all Flybe flights are canceled,” consumer director for CAA Paul Smith was quoted saying. In a statement posted to social media Flybe warned that canceled flights “will not be rescheduled.” The company has been placed into administration, according to the statement. The Exeter-based budget carrier was founded in 1979 and at one point was Europe’s largest independent regional airline, carrying 8 million passengers a year and operating more than 200 routes. The airline had been struggling before Saturday’s announcement. Flybe collapsed over the coronavirus pandemic as the outbreak tipped the entire global airline industry into crisis. It was rescued in 2021 after administrators agreed on a deal with company Thyme Opco.
