Samsung’s quarterly profits have plunged to their lowest level in eight years as customers snapped up fewer cell phones and laptops. The tech giant reported operating profit of 4.3 trillion Korean won ($3.5 billion) on Tuesday for the three months ended December, down 69% from a year ago.

Samsung said it took in 302.2 trillion won ($245.7 billion) in revenue for the full year of 2022, up from 279.6 trillion won ($227.4 billion) in 2021, and a record high. Analysts have said, however, that they expect the company’s profits to drop again this quarter because of a continued decline in memory chip prices.
