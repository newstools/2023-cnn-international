Shares of embattled Swiss bank Credit Suisse fell to a record low Tuesday after a report that regulators are reviewing comments the lender’s chairman made about the health of its finances. The bank’s stock plunged as much as 9% to trade at 2.52 Swiss francs ($2.73), before recovering slightly. Earlier in the day, Reuters, citing two people with knowledge of the matter, reported that Switzerland’s financial regulator was seeking to establish the extent to which Axel Lehmann, and other bank representatives, were aware that clients were still withdrawing funds when he told reporters that outflows had stopped. Lehmann made the remarks in interviews on December 1 and December 2, Reuters said. On December 2, the bank’s stock jumped by 9.3%. Lehmann may not have been briefed correctly before he made those comments, according to one of the people quoted by Reuters. Credit Suisse told CNN Tuesday: “We do not comment on speculation.” The Swiss financial regulator, Finma, declined to comment. The latest cloud to emerge over Credit Suisse

The rumors, which sparked a selloff in the lender’s shares, followed a series of missteps and compliance failures that cost Credit Suisse billions. The bank is now in the middle of a major restructuring plan that entails cutting 9,000 full-time jobs, spinning off its investment bank and focusing on wealth management. It expects to make another substantial loss in 2023. — Julia Horowitz and Rob North contributed reporting.
