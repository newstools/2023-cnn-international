The BAFTA Film Awards took place at the Royal Festival Hall in London, England on Sunday. The German film “All Quiet on the Western Front” was the sweeping victor of the night, winning seven awards including best film and best director. “We’ve been blessed with so many nominations and winning this is just incredible,” said producer Malte Grunert on stage. “The Banshees of Inisherin” was also favored at the event, clinching both the supporting actor and supporting actress awards, as well as best original screenplay, among others. “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” a favorite heading into next month’s Oscar, was largely snubbed on Sunday, taking home only one award, for best editing. Heading into the show, German film “All Quiet on the Western Front” led with 14 nominations, followed by ten nominations apiece for “The Banshees of Inisherin” and “Everything Everywhere All At Once.” “Elvis” rounded out the pack of top contenders with nine BAFTA nods.
