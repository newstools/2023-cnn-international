Jamie Lee Curtis has offered the ultimate hint that there is a “Freaky Friday” sequel in the works. Released in 2003, the original fantasy-comedy centered on Dr. Tess Coleman (Curtis) and her teenage daughter Anna, played by Lindsay Lohan, who switch bodies with awkward and hilarious results. Two decades on, and Curtis has hinted that fans should be preparing for a follow-up to the beloved Disney film, which was a remake of a 1976 film of the same name. “It’s going to happen,” she told Variety at the Producers Guild of America Awards on Saturday. “Without saying there’s anything officially happening, I’m looking at you in this moment and saying, ‘Of course it’s going to happen.’ It’s going to happen.” This is a significant update, as the “Halloween” star has been tantalizing fans for a while with her not-so-subtle “Freaky Friday” sequel hints. Earlier this month, she shared a throwback photo of herself and Lohan on Instagram, along with the caption: “It’s Friday. I’m just sayin! Freaky fingers crossed! @lindsaylohan @disney.” Lohan commented on the post with crossed fingers emojis as well as a heart-eyes smiley face and two hands up. In an appearance on ABC’s “The View” in October, Curtis revealed she already had some ideas for the plot. “I would like to see Lindsay be the hot grandma, and I would like to see me try to deal with toddlers today,” she said. “I want to be a helicopter parent in today’s world.” CNN has reached out to Disney for comment. While fans await official news of Curtis’ return to one of her best-loved roles, the star has been busy excelling in her other projects. On Sunday night, she took home the SAG award for outstanding performance by a female actor in a supporting role for her acclaimed performance in “Everything Everywhere All at Once.”
