Rebel Wilson and Ramona Agruma are engaged, the Australian actress shared on Instagram on Sunday. “We said YES!” Wilson said in the post, which was accompanied by photos of the couple at Disneyland, where the engagement appears to have taken place. Wilson’s representative Marcy Engelman confirmed the couple is engaged in an email to CNN. In the social media post, Wilson and Agruma were seen wearing matching pink and white sweaters surrounded by pink roses with Disneyland’s iconic Sleeping Beauty Castle in the background. A photo of Agruma’s Tiffany & Co. ring was also featured in the announcement. Disneyland seems to be a fitting location for Wilson and Agruma, who went public with their relationship in June 2022. “I thought I was searching for a Disney Prince … but maybe what I really needed all this time was a Disney Princess,” Wilson said at the time. Agruma is the founder of Lemon Ve Limon, a Los Angeles-based clothing brand, according to her Instagram biography. It’s been a year of milestones for Wilson, who welcomed a daughter, Royce Lillian, via surrogate in November 2022. “I can’t even describe the love I have for her, she’s a beautiful miracle!” Wilson wrote in an Instagram post. “I am forever grateful to everyone who has been involved, (you know who you are), this has been years in the making…but particularly wanted to thank my gorgeous surrogate who carried her and birthed her with such grace and care.”
