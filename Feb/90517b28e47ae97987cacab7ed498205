Tom Sizemore, the “Saving Private Ryan” actor, is hospitalized in intensive care after suffering a brain aneurysm, his spokesperson told CNN on Sunday morning. Sizemore is in critical condition and is in a “wait and see situation,” said the spokesperson, Charles Lago. “His family is aware and waiting for updates.” Lago said. “There is no further update at this time.” Sizemore, a 61-year-old from Detroit, appeared in a number of hit crime and war movies in the 90s and 2000s, including in the films “Heat,” “Natural Born Killers,” “Pearl Harbor” and “Black Hawk Down.” Often portraying tough guys, he is perhaps best known for playing Sgt. Mike Horvath in the World War II movie “Saving Private Ryan.” As the loyal sergeant alongside star Tom Hanks, Sizemore delivers the titular line toward the end of the movie: “Some day we might look back on this and decide that saving Private Ryan was the one decent thing we were able to pull out of this godawful s***ty mess.” In addition, he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in 2000 for Best Performance by an Actor in a Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television for his role in “Witness Protection.” More recently, he appeared in episodes of the TV series “Twin Peaks” and “Cobra Kai.” Sizemore has long struggled with drug addiction and had a litany of legal issues during his career. He was convicted in 2003 on domestic violence charges stemming from a relationship with his former fiancee Heidi Fleiss. He told CNN’s Larry King in a 2010 interview he had been addicted to cocaine, heroin and meth, and he participated in the 2010 season of the reality show “Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew.”
